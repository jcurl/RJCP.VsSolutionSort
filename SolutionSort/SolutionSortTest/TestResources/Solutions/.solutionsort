# The presence of this file, on its own without any rules indicates that no
# solution file shall be processed in this folder or subfolders.
#
# If the file has no regular expressions, the default is to not process any
# solutions.
#
# If you only want to process specific solutions:
#
# [include]
# regex
#
# If you only want to not process specific solutions:
#
# [exclude]
# regex
#
# If you want to process a bunch of solutions, except for a few, you'd define a
# include section that filters what to check, and it's included unless it's in
# the exclude block.
# 
# Comments *must* have a '#' at the beginning.
#
# This file has no regular expressions, therefore, it excludes by default all
# files.
